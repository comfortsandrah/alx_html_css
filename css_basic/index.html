          I am a talented full-stack developer with a strong focus on front-end
          technologies. As a Computer Science student at JKUAT, I am steadily
          building a solid foundation in the principles of computer science and
          software engineering. I have been selected as a trainee in the ALX
          program. I am further refining my skills and gaining valuable hands-on
          experience in the field. My exceptional problem-solving abilities and
          collaborative mindset have earned me recognition within my teams,
          positioning me as a rising star in full-stack development.

        <h3>Tell us about yourself</h3>
        <p>
          I have developed and demonstrated an ability to manage projects and
          lead teams, preparing for future leadership roles in technology and
          management. My passion for design and building applications has
          cultivated a deep interest in working with both front-end and back-end
          web technologies. I am proficient in various programming languages and
          frameworks, including Python, JavaScript, Dart with Flutter, React,
          Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. This breadth of technical expertise
          allows me to tackle a wide variety of software development challenges
          with confidence and efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also honed a set of valuable soft skills that contribute to my
          overall professional competence: leadership skills, teamwork, grit,
          critical thinking, analytical thinking, and problem-solving skills. As
          an aspiring full-stack developer, I am drawn to the opportunity to
          work across the entire software development lifecycle, from the
          front-end user experience to the back-end infrastructure. I would
          bring a unique combination of technical expertise, problem-solving
          skills, and a customer-centric mindset to any client or employer's
          day-to-day business operations.
